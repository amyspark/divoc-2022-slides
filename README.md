# Amyspark's DiVOC: Breaking Bubbles talks

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for my two talks:

- "The Last Frontier on ICC Profiles": https://pretalx.c3voc.de/divoc-bb3/talk/BP8NKN/
- "The Curse of Slide Making": https://pretalx.c3voc.de/divoc-bb3/talk/CYKFMB/

The DiVOC brand/styling repo is added as a submodule, issue

```
git submodule update --init
```

to fetch their content as well.

I added a cleaned up logo in the `assets/` folder of this repo.
